# generic-session-example-dotnet
An example of generic interaction with session 

This repo arose after a work item in my day to day work where we had a cross cutting concern to centralise session interaction. 

This repo was used as a teaching toolset and the implementations are fairly thin because of this. 

There is some interesting points in here around a "faux-onion" architecture, usage of generics and also a nice example of a very basic middleware. 

To run this project you will need Dot Net Core 3.1. 

You can then run either the console app in the repo or the web (MVC) app to get an idea for how session works within .NET in an isolated way.
